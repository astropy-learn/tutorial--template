    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the astroquery package to get a list of stars in the Gaia catalogue with high proper motions and measured radial velocities. We will then visualize the resulting star positions on a 2D Aitoff-projected grid, and in 3 dimensions. Next we will use the functionality built into the Astropy coordinates framework to project the path of our collection of stars forward in time. Finally, we will visualize the movement of the stars by creating an animation within matplotlib.\n",
